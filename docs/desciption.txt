The Project will tackle the following research questions using Python. 

1) Is there a difference in life expectancy between city states? 

2) What state has the largest increase or decrease in life expectancy from 2022 to 2050?

3) Is there currently a difference in life expectancy between the most populated state NRW and Baveria. 

4) Is there a difference in life expectancy between male and female from today until 2050 in Berlin? Does Hamburg show the same result? 

6) How do states where the AFD has a large voter base compare to a more liberal states? 



Why this data set and why this topic? 

Analyzing the life expectancy accross states in germany is an interesting topic, not just because of it past, especially the reunification in 1990, but also to have a glimps into the future. 
Furthermore, there might be regional variations: east - west, rural - city, south - north, Germany - Baveria. Each state has distinct characteristics, including demographics and socioeconomic factors. 
Examining this can provide insights into the effectiveness of local healthcare policies, lifestyle factors, and socioeconomic disparities.

Finally, getting some insight into the life expectancy across German might help me in the future, iff I were to start a famility what states I better should not move to. Maybe the results will harden my prior bias that was based
on how people voted in the last elections, maybe not.
