The Project will tackle questions regarding the projected population of each state in Germany. 

1) Is there a difference a difference in population increase between city states from 2022 and 2070? 
2) What state has the largest increase and decrease in population from 2022 to 2070? In absolute number as well in relation to current population.
3) How is the general trend from 2022 and 2070 for former east German states and west German states?
4) Is there a difference in population growth between genders from 2022 and 2070 across the whole country?  
5) Does the same apply in east vs west?
6) How much does the population decrease and increase in Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen for both male and female, from 2022 to 2040 and finally from 2040 to 2070? 


# Let's Talk about Data

The Datasets origin is from [Genesis, ]{https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online} a statistical data service provided by the German government. 

### Dataset used is
GENESIS-Tabelle: 12421-0004, Staat population projections with moderate life expectancy and moderate net migration


Data is used was split in 2 seperate csv files. This one done to circumvent dataset size restriction for free users. 
Data is recorded in time steps from 2022 then 2025 and continueing in steps of 5 years until 2070 
Age groups are initialy of 1 year each from 0 to 101.  
values are in 1000s for the projected population per year.

## Why this topic? 

There are multiple reasons why analyzing the projected population might be interesting. 
In general this can be intersting for planning and policy development, resource allocation, healthcare and public health planning as well as economic forecasting.

For Germany this might be especially interesting, not just because of it past, especially the reunification in 1990, but also to have a glimps into the future. 

There might be regional variations: east - west, rural - city, south - north, Germany - Baveria. Each state has distinct characteristics, including demographics and socioeconomic factors. 
Examining this can provide insights into the effectiveness of local policies.

Finally, getting some insight into the prospective population across Germany might help me in the future, iff I were to start a famility what states I better should not move to.
This is especially true when considering long-term property investments.
