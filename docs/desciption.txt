The Project will tackle the following research questions using Python. 

1) Is there a difference in life expectancy between city states? 

2) What state has the largest increase or decrease in life expectancy from 2022 to 2050?

3) Is there currently a difference in life expectancy between the most populace state NRW and abroad in Baveria. 

4) Is there a difference in life expectancy between male and female from today until 2050 in Berlin?

5) Does Hamburg show the same result? 

6) How do all states compare to each other? 


I choose this topic because it would be interesting to see and analyse whether or not there is a difference between states. Especially now that Germany is united since 32 years.
